I. ABOUT THIS ALGORITHM:
- Well, Clustering Algorithm is not as complicated as its name.
- This algorithm will split data into groups which have the same patterns.
 
II. ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
- There are many libraries have already included this algorithm such as scikit-learn machine learning library.
- But if you code it yourself  -->  more understanding, you won't have to rely on those libs anymore!
- Download the .exe file to try it yourself! :D

III. HOW TO USE MY PROGRAM:
- Left click to add points or just click "Random Points".
- Right click to add centroids or can randomly add by click "+" , remove the lastest centroid by using "-".
- After having points and centroids click on "Update" and sometimes can be used multiple times.
- If you want to start a new one just "Reset All" and start again.
