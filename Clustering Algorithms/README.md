- Well, Clustering Algorithm is not as complicated as its name.
- This algorithm will split data into groups which have the same patterns.
 
II. ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
- There are many libraries have already included this algorithm such as scikit-learn machine learning library.
- But if you code it yourself  -->  more understanding, you won't have to rely on those libs anymore!
 
III. HOW TO USE MY PROGRAM:
