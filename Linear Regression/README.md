I. ABOUT THIS ALGORITHM:
- Well, Linear Regression is not as complicated as its name.
- This algorithm will draw a line (y=ax+b).
- Predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.
 
II. ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
- There are many libraries have already included this algorithm such as scikit-learn machine learning library.
- But if you code it yourself  -->  more understanding, you won't have to rely on those libs anymore!
- Download the .exe file to try it yourself! :D 
- Some images:

III. HOW TO USE MY PROGRAM:
- Left click to add points.
- Right click to remove the lastest point.
- After having points click "Sketch" and it will draw the line y=ax+b.
- If you want to work with new set of data, click "Clear" and start again.
