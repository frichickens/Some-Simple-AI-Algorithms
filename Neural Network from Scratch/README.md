I. ABOUT THIS ALGORITHM:
- Train a neural network to predict diabetes from indicators of body.
 
II. ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
- Could be implemented more simply by using libraries.
- Require knowledge about: Algebra, Calculus, Backpropagation, Activation Functions, Gradient descent.
- A lot of inspiration could help also! :D
